This repository is an archive containing the source code of version 1.0 of Mago Debugger.

I've converted it from the Subversion repo at http://dsource.org/projects/mago_debugger in case dsource is ever lost.

The current project is now hosted at https://github.com/rainers/mago and maintained by Rainer Schuetze.
